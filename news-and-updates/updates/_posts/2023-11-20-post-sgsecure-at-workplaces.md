![](/images/news/SGSecure_page_banner.jpg)
Play a part in the SGSecure national movement by making sure that your organisation is prepared and ready to respond to and recover from a terror attack.

The threat of terrorism in Singapore continues to remain real and present. Workplaces, being an important part of our community, need to be prepared and stay resilient in the face of terror threats.
 
[SGSecure@Workplaces](/sgsecure/) aims to strengthen workplaces’ ability to respond to and recover from terror attacks and other situations that may adversely affect the harmonious working relationships at workplaces.
 
Learn how you can build up organisational resilience by [adopting the 3P approach](http://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/sgsecure/overview):
 
- Prepare your workforce
- Protect your workplace
- Partner your community
 
How can I strengthen my organisation’s resilience against terror attacks and crises?
