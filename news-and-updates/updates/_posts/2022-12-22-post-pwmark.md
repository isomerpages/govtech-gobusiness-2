Starting from 22 December 2022, applications for the Progressive Wage (PW) Mark can be submitted on GoBusiness.

The [PW Mark](/accreditation/pwmark/?src=news_and_update) is an accreditation scheme that recognises eligible firms that pay progressive wages to lower-wage workers. It enables consumers and corporate buyers to identify and support such firms, and helps firms attract and retain workers as a progressive employer. From 1 March 2023, the PW Mark is also required for eligible suppliers who are awarded government contracts.

To be eligible for the PW Mark, applicants must:

- Hire at least 1 local worker covered by the prevailing Sectoral PWs or Occupational PWs that have taken effect.

- Pay the relevant workers according to PW requirements.

- Pay all other local workers at least the Local Qualifying Salary (LQS).

**PW Mark Plus**

Firms that meet the criteria for the PW Mark and also adopt the Tripartite Standard on Advancing Well-being of Lower-Wage Workers will be conferred the PW Mark Plus.

**How to apply**

Users can [log in to GoBusiness](https://dashboard.gobusiness.gov.sg/accreditations/pwmark?src=news_and_update) as a Business User, go to the PW Mark page and click on Apply.
