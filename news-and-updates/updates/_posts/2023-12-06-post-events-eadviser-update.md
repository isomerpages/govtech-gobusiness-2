### Updates on e-Adviser for Events

![](/images/news/News_Events eAdviser launch.png)

We have updated our e-Adviser for Events! Please log in before using the e-Adviser to create a guided journey. Your personalised recommendations are now saved in your GoBusiness recommendations for reference when you are ready to apply for your licences / permits.

To improve your experience, the recommendation now groups licences in a recommended application sequence to reduce processing delays.
