Information and services for the Skills Development Levy will be moved to GoBusiness.

Starting from 31 January 2024, information and resources for Skills Development Levy (SDL) will be available on GoBusiness.

The SDL is a compulsory levy that employers have to pay for all your employees, including foreign employees, working in Singapore. This is in addition to the monthly CPF contributions.

Business owners have typically been accessing SDL services via its own website. But as part of GoBusinessâ€™ efforts to offer easy access to a full suite of employer-related services, they can now get SDL information and perform SDL transactions, such as submitting payment or filing a Notice of Objection, directly on GoBusiness.

To find out more about SDL and access SDL services, log in to [GoBusiness](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/login/).
