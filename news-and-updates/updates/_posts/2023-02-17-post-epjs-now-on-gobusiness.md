Starting from 18 February 2023, the Enterprise Portal for Jobs and Skills (EPJS) will be moving to GoBusiness.

EPJS is a portal for businesses to find information and resources on relevant jobs and skills initiatives under SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) and Workforce Singapore (WSG). This move is part of a whole-of-government effort to enhance the enterprise digital experience and allow users to easily access the full suite of employer-related services via a single touchpoint.
