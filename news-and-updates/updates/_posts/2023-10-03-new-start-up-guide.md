## A new and improved Start-up Guide for new businesses

![](/images/start/StartSJ_BusinessStructure.jpg)
Easier and more user-friendly step-by-step guidance for registering a sole proprietorship or partnership.

Sole proprietorship/partnership owners can now find their way to the relevant e-Adviser and other resources faster and easier.

** Register a Sole Proprietorship/Partnership via e-Adviser**

A direct link to the e-Adviser can now be found on the GoBusiness homepage, allowing for quick and simple navigation. The e-Adviser guides users through [6 easy steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq1McYEo8Rg) to register the business.

** Start-up Guide**

The [Start-up Guide](https://govtech-gobusiness-main-staging.netlify.app/start-a-business/?src=topnav) also provides users with a quick overview of what needs to be done when registering a business in Singapore. Written in layman terms for easy understanding, the Start-up Guide also highlights links that are specific to registering a sole proprietorship/partnership.

Users can also now add Guided Journey to their GoBusiness Dashboard to start the application immediately after completing the e-Adviser. Previously, even when users have already completed the e-Adviser, they would be required to log in and complete it again before they can add Guided Journey. This new improvement will help save time and make the process more seamless.
