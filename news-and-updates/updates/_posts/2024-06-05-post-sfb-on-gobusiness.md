The Enterprise Portal for Jobs & Skills has been revamped and renamed as the new SkillsFuture for Business portal. It remains your one-stop portal for your organisationâ€™s upskilling needs. 
 
Enjoy the improved portal layout to help you better appreciate our range of SkillsFuture initiatives and resources, and how they can support the various aspects of your business transformation.  
 
You can still access related digital services such as SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (SFEC) balance or submit an Absentee Payroll claim via the e-services tab.  
 
From July 2024, be sure to also check out our enhanced enterprise course directory. With sharper search filters and recommendations, it can help you better identify training courses most relevant for your workforce.
