The Enterprise Portal for Jobs & Skills and SkillsFuture for Enterprise have been revamped and consolidated into the new SkillsFuture for Business on GoBusiness. It remains as the  one-stop resource portal for your organisation’s upskilling needs.
 
Users can now take advantage of the an improved layout to  effectively explore the full range of SkillsFuture initiatives and resources, and discover how they can bolster various aspects of your business transformation.  

The portal will also feature an enhanced [Enterprise Course Directory](https://skillsfuture.gobusiness.gov.sg/course-directory/search){:rel='noopener'}. Equipped with more comprehensive filters, it can better help employers narrow down their search and find suitable courses according to their needs and criteria.

Each course page also includes concise and key information to help users better understand the course scope. With these improvements, the Enterprise Course Directory now makes SFEC-eligible programmes more searchable and easier to shortlist.

Users may still access related digital services such as checking SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (SFEC) balance or  submitting Absentee Payroll claims via the e-Services tab.  

Access the new [SkillsFuture for Business](https://skillsfuture.gobusiness.gov.sg/){:rel='noopener'} today!
