## GoBusiness now lets users verify companies’ PW Mark and licences

![](/images/news/News_PW Mark and Licences.jpg)

Users can now better validate the credibility of employers and corporations on GoBusiness, with the PW Mark Verifier and licence enquiry service.

PW Mark Verifier

The PW Mark is an accreditation scheme that recognises eligible firms that pay progressive wages to lower-wage workers. It enables consumers, corporate buyers and job applicants to identify such firms — and with the PW Mark Verifier, identifying them is much easier.

This service allows employees to check if their potential employers have obtained the PW Mark or PW Mark Plus, as well as government agencies to find out the accreditation status of firms who have bid for government contracts. The PW Mark Verifier is available for use by anyone, with no login required.

Licence Enquiry Service

For members of the public who wish to verify if an entity or corporation has a specific licence, they can now use GoBusiness’ licence enquiry service to do so by entering relevant search keywords. No login is required for this either.
