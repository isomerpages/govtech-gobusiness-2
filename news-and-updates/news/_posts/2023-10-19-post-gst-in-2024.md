Come 1 January 2024, the GST rate will be raised from 8% to 9%, as part of the two-step GST rate change announced by the Minister for Finance in Budget 2022. The first step from 7% to 8% had taken place earlier on 1 January 2023.

**Next steps**

To ensure a smooth transition to the new 9% GST rate, all GST-registered businesses are encouraged to  do these three things early:
1) Update their systems to incorporate the new GST rate from 1 January 2024;
2) Prepare their price displays to reflect the new GST rate from 1 January 2024; and
3) Understand the GST rate change transitional rules and apply the correct GST rate for sales transactions and reverse charge supplies spanning 1 January 2024.

Businesses should avoid these three common errors:
- Error 1: Charging GST at 9% before 1 January 2024
- Error 2: Charging or displaying GST at 8% on/after 1 January 2024
- Error 3: GST amount is computed correctly but wrong GST rate is reflected on receipts/invoices issued

**Communicating reasons for price increases**

All businesses are to communicate reasons for any price increases transparently with consumers. Businesses should explain the main reasons for the increases in price/ fee, and not misrepresent the situation to consumers by increasing the price more than necessary, and attributing it primarily or solely to the increase in GST. The Committee Against Profiteering takes a serious view of any unjustified price increases using the GST increase as an excuse and will investigate all feedback on such cases.
