### Receive funding support as you tap on the rich experience and skillsets of senior workers

Become an early adopter of higher retirement/re-employment ages and/or implement a part-time re-employment policy for your senior workers. Be seen as a progressive employer to attract and retain more talent. You will also enjoy government funding to support your progressive employment practices.

You can refer to the Tripartite Standard on Age-Friendly Workplace Practices (TS-AWP), to implement good age management at the workplace, to treat older workers fairly and support them in areas such as training and workplace health programmes

### How you can benefit:

- Grow your business with the valuable experience and skillsets of senior workers

- Attract and retain more talents as a progressive employer

- Tap on government funding to support progressive employment practices

### Subsidies and funding:

- Under the Senior Worker Early Adopter Grant (SWEAG) and Part Time Re-employment Grant (PTRG), you can receive funding support of up to S$125,000 each to implement the following policy changes in your organisation:
         - SWEAG: Raise both your internal retirement and re-employment ages by 3* years above minimum statutory requirements, ahead of the legislative schedule
         - J8PTRG: Commit to a part-time re-employment policy for your eligible senior workers

* The increase in the internal Retirement Age (RA) and Re-employment Age (REA) of a minimum of 3 years (from existing statutory RA and REA of 62 and 67 respectively) to qualify for the SW EAG would be applicable only if companies apply for the grant before 5 July 2021.

If the application of the grant is on 5 July 2021 or after, companies would have to raise their internal RA and REA to at least 66 and 71 respectively, i.e. a minimum of 3 years from the new RA and REA of 63 and 68 respectively that would take effect on 1 July 2022. This allows senior workers in these firms to benefit fully from three years of higher internal RA and REA, which is what the SW EAG is designed to promote.

### Eligibility criteria:

- Your organisation will need to have at least 1 senior worker aged 60 years and above
