Developed by WSG as part of the enhancement to the existing Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG), the Support for Job Redesign under Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG-JR) encourages enterprises to work with pre-approved Job Redesign (JR) consultants to redesign work processes, tasks and responsibilities to attract and retain better workers.

A panel of pre-approved JR consultants has also been appointed to help organisations redesign work processes, tasks and responsibilities.
