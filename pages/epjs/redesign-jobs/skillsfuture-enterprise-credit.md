### Invest in your business and workforce transformation with additional support

The SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (SFEC) is a $10,000 credit provided by the government to further encourage enterprises to embark on business and workforce transformation. Eligible enterprises will benefit from an additional 90% funding support for their out-of-pocket expenses when they take up relevant initiatives for business and/or workforce transformation.

### How it works:

The SFEC supports programmes under two broad categories:

- **Enterprise Transformation**: Programmes that support enterprise transformation
