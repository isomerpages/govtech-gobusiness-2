### Implement job redesign to create quality and meaningful careers in the Retail Sector

The Job Redesign Framework for Retail guides retailers in implementing Job Redesign to review their employees' job scopes in order to improve productivity and efficiency, optimise workforce and improve job attraction and retention. It will also assist retailers in equipping employees with the right skills to deliver an optimal retail experience to meet evolving customer needs amidst the highly competitive retail landscape.

As retailers innovate and adopt technology to provide unique, engaging shopping experiences that transit seamlessly from offline to offline and vice versa, these initiatives will also assist them in automating repetitive tasks and redeploying existing employees to higher-value roles to support their business transformation.
