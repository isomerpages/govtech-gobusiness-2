### Implement job redesign to create quality and meaningful careers in the Security Industry

The Security Productivity Initiative (SPI) was introduced in September 2017 as part of WSG's efforts to support the Security Industry Transformation Map (ITM). With a structured Job Redesign (JR) Framework, the SPI aims to guide and support security organisations in workforce transformation through job redesign and human capital development.

As the Security Industry transforms itself to deliver advanced services through adopting technology and better security outcomes, the SPI will further encourage security organisations to develop your security personnel, as well as create better and quality jobs to sustain the changes in your business operations.

### Who is this for:

The SPI is for security organisations who are keen to create quality jobs and meaningful careers for your workforce through job redesign. Security service buyers may also benefit from the strategies and resources related to Outcome-Based Contracting (OBC).

### How you can benefit:

- Implement job redesign solutions to enhance productivity and security outcomes

- Equip employees with the right skills to support your business transformation

- Attract and retain talent through redesigned, quality job roles and progressive human capital (HC) practices

The following resources are available to help you embark on and sustain job redesign efforts. Those requiring funding support can access the list of government support programmes through the "Guide to Security Workforce Transformation", or get in touch with WSG via the contact information provided below.
