### Implement job redesign to create quality and meaningful careers in the Security Industry

The Security Productivity Initiative (SPI) is part of WSG’s efforts to support the Security Industry Transformation Map (ITM). With a structured Job Redesign (JR) Framework, the SPI aims to <u>guide companies to become manpower-lean with security technology adoption, job redesign and adoption of human capital best practices.</u>

Since the implementation of the Security ITM, the Security Industry has been transforming to deliver advanced services through technology adoption and better security outcomes. This encourages companies to further develop their security personnel and to create better and quality jobs in order to sustain the changes in business operations.
