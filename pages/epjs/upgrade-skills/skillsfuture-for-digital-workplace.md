### Equipping Singaporean adults with digital literacy skills for the digital economy

The SFDW 2.0 programme aims to equip Singaporean adults with digital literacy skills to prepare them for the digital economy. Employers will be able to tap on the SFDW 2.0 to equip their employees with the right mind-set and skills for the digital economy.

SSG has also worked with the appointed programme partners to develop customised training programmes for six sectors - namely Built Environment, Food Services, Manufacturing, Retail, Tourism and Transportation. Employers in other sectors who wish to contextualise the training programme can also approach SSG's appointed programme partners to do so.
