### Train key personnel to be technology innovators to achieve manufacturing excellence

The Operations MaNagement Innovation (OMNI) Programme is a joint initiative by the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech) and SSG. The programme aims to train key personnel such as engineers, managers and senior staff of companies to be technology innovators to achieve manufacturing excellence. Delivered based on SIMTech's proven Operations Management Innovation methodology (OmniMethodology<sup>TM</sup>), the programme comprises a 40-hour classroom training component in operations management techniques and another 40-hour mentorship by the experienced trainers to implement productivity improvement projects at the workplace.

The two course modules are:

1. **Apply Operations Improvement Fundamentals (40 hours)**<br>This unit provides the necessary fundamental knowledge and concepts needed to understand operations management.

2. **Improve Operations Actions Using OmniMethodology<sup>TM</sup> (On-site Mentorship)(40 hours)**<br>This unit trains participants to evaluate and identify operations improvement areas and set performance objectives.<br>The training will be company-based, with both on-site and scheduled review sessions. Upon completion of this unit, the participants will be ready to embark on the identification of suitable initiatives that can help the company improve its operations, achieve its competitive strategy and performance targets identified. This is the second step towards becoming a technology innovator of a company.
