### Be Workplace Learning:Ready (WPL:READY) and fast track skills certifications for your employees

The Workplace Skills Recognition (WPSR) programme aims to help enterprises, particularly SMEs, build a foundation in workplace learning and recognise skills trained at the workplace. 
 
Enterprises that have established systems and processes to support on-the-job training can approach the National Centre of Excellence for Workplace Learning (NACE) to assess the readiness of your organisation to meet the Workplace Learning:Ready (WPL:READY) requirements and apply for the certification.

Attaining the WPL:READY mark under the WPSR will enable you to fast track skills assessment and help your workers gain formal recognition of the skills they have developed at the workplace, without the need to go for external training.

For enterprises that require assistance, NACE is able to help you build workplace learning capabilities through various training programmes and consultancy services.

### How does it work?

SSG recognises enterprises that have attained the WPL:READY mark to have established structured workplace learning processes to train their employees systematically on-the-job. Such structured learning on-the-job is authentic and can be recognised for skills assessment. Under WPSR, WPL:READY enterprises will be able to work with SSG's appointed training partners to certify the skills of their employees through the Assessment-Only-Pathway (AOP) mode to attain relevant Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) certifications. This significantly reduces employees' time away from work and is an efficient way to recognise workers' skills. 

The WPSR will be piloted in the Food Services and Retail sectors from Q2 2023, and will be progressively expanded to more sectors. More details on the launch and the application process will be made available in due course.
