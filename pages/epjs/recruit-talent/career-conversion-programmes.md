### Meet manpower needs through Career Conversion Programmes

Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs) help companies to meet their manpower needs by providing employers with salary support to reskill mid-career new hires and existing employees  for growth jobs in demand. WSG offers CCPs across around 30 sectors.

---

### There are 3 modes of CCPs:

1.	Place-and-Train: companies hire jobseekers and put the individuals through on-the-job training (OJT) or industry-recognised training to take on a new growth job role. 
2.	Attach-and -Train: companies act as host employers to provide jobseekers with training and work attachments, in growth job roles where there are good prospects for placement. 
3.	Job Redesign (JR) Reskilling: companies can send any existing employee for reskilling to take on new or redesigned job roles aligned with Industry Transformation Maps/Jobs Transformation Maps.
