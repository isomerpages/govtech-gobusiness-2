### Reskill Mid-career Individuals through Career Conversion Programmes

Career Conversion Programmes (CCPs) help companies to meet their manpower needs by reskilling mid-career new hires and workers for growth jobs in demand. WSG offers close to 100 CCPs across around 30 sectors to support companies in reskilling mid-career individuals to take on new job roles.

### There are 3 modes of CCPs:

1. Place-and-Train: Mid-career individual is hired by a participating employer before undergoing training to take on a new job role.

2. Attach-and -Train: Mid-career individual is provided with training and work attachments, prior to job placement, through industry partners in growth sectors with good future job opportunities

3. Redeployment / Job Redesign (JR) Reskilling: Targeted at companies that are undergoing business transformation, and where their existing workers are at risk of redundancy or in vulnerable jobs due to the transformation. These workers will be provided with training to take on new job roles or redesigned job roles within the same company.
