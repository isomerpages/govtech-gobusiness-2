Note: While WSG provides SGUJS Placement Partners with a fee per qualifying job placement or attachment enrolment, employers may wish to note that SGUJS Placement Partners operate as licenced employment agencies, and may charge employers a placement fee.

WSG encourages employers to consider the fees provided by WSG to SGUJS Placement Partners when negotiating any placement/ enrolment fees with the SGUJS Placement Partner.
