### Train, host, and hire mid-career individuals through project attachments at your company

### How you can benefit:

All SCTP courses will include industry involvement such as industry attachments and projects. Trainees will also receive employment facilitation support, on top of training.

As an employer, you can partner the training providers to offer industry attachments and projects at your company as part of the SCTP. This will provide you with access to these mid-career individuals and widen your reach to a talent pool to support your manpower needs.

### Subsidies and funding:

The SCTP courses are for self-sponsored individuals and will be subsidised at SSG's prevailing funding rates.
