### Testimonials

*"We're very pleased with what Think SME has provided for this branding & marketing project. Their team has been very prompt and accommodating to my request throughout the entire project. As our company is providing medical gloves to customers such as laboratories and pharmaceutical production, this rebranding exercise will be able to help us stand out from our competitors and provide very distinct brand identity to serve our clients better. We're also very impressed with the new branding packaging proposals which Think SME helped us for our home brand, ShieldPro. We wanted all 3 proposals actually as they were all very nicely designed! Highly recommended for all SMEs who are interested to tap on this EDG grant to do a rebranding exercise, u will definitely not regret it! Good job guys!"* - Bino, Director, B&C Laboratory Supplies Pte Ltd

*"The new brand concept definitely gives our company a new refreshed look and the rebranding timing came just nice when we expanded to a new bigger office and change in management structure. Thank you Callum, Edison and Nick for hand holding us throughout the entire grant process, from application, rework from ESG to successfully obtaining the claim! Thank you, Think SME once again!"* - Barbara, Marketing Manager, Ecopluz Pte Ltd

*"Since implementing the fully customised preschool management system, our operations have been completely transformed. With its intuitive features and streamlined processes, we have saved time and reduced errors in tasks such as enrolment, attendance tracking, scheduling, and billing. The system's parent communication tools have fostered better collaboration and transparency, allowing us to provide a nurturing and enriching environment for our students while keeping parents well-informed."* - Corrine, Operation Manager, Childcare@fernvale Pte. Ltd.
