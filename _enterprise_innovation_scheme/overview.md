### How to Apply

Businesses may claim the enhanced deductions/ allowances in their income tax returns. Businesses must maintain adequate records of their qualifying activities and expenditures and provide them to IRAS upon request.

Eligible businesses that wish to convert their qualifying expenditures into cash are to make an irrevocable option by submitting a prescribed election form together with the filing of the businesses’ income tax returns. The option must be exercised not later than the income tax filing due date for the relevant YA.

### Innovation Projects carried out with Polytechnics, the ITE or other qualified partners

Businesses undertaking innovation projects that are capital in nature and do not meet the definition of R&D under Section 2 of the Income Tax Act, may be eligible for tax deductions if these projects are qualifying innovation projects carried out with the polytechnics, the ITE or other qualified partners (collectively known as “partner institutions”). 

Qualifying innovation projects refer to projects that predominantly involve one or more of the following innovation activities defined within the Oslo Manual 2018:

a. Research and experimental development activities;

b. Engineering, design and other creative work activities;

c. IP-related activities; and

d. Software development and database activities.

This scheme will be administered by the partner institutions. The partner institutions will validate the project as a qualifying innovation project and issue the innovation project invoice. Expenditure incurred outside of the collaboration with the partner institutions will not qualify for this tax deduction. 

Businesses seeking to undertake qualifying innovation projects may contact the respective partner institutions for more information.
