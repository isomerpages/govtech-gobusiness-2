### Good record keeping practices

Good [record keeping](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/basics-of-corporate-income-tax/record-keeping-requirements) is important to run a business. Companies that adopt good record keeping practices are able to:

- Make better business decisions
- Be aware of the financial status of the company (e.g. profit or loss position, whether there is internal fraud or theft)
- Reduce the cost and effort required to file the Corporate Income Tax Returns, and to reply to IRASâ€™ queries (if any)

You may use an [accounting software](https://www.iras.gov.sg/digital-collaboration/for-software-developers/accounting-tax-software/iras-accounting-software-register-plus/asr-plus-listing) in your business to facilitate record keeping and accurately capture the accounting information.
