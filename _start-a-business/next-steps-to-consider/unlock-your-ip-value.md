![Protect your ideas](/images/start/StartSJ_StartSJ_TrademarksIP.jpg)

### Protect your business

Intangible assets now make up 90% of all business value, according to an [Ocean Tomo study](https://oceantomo.com/intangible-asset-market-value-study/
){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Your inventions, designs and representations of your brand are part of your businessâ€™ [intangible assets and intellectual property (IA/IP)](https://www.ipos.gov.sg/about-ip){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} that should be protected. Common forms of IP are trade marks (representation of your brands), patents (your inventions) and designs.

Whether you are a budding entrepreneur, a start-up, a SME or an MNC, protecting and managing your IP can help your business grow. Having a strong IP portfolio can open up commercial opportunities for your business such as research & development (R&D) partnerships, securing investments, licensing and franchising.
