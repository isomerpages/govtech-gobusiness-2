### How to choose your business structure

Here are some questions to help you decide:

- What is the nature of my business?
- How many owners will there be?
- How much capital will I invest?
- What risks am I prepared to take?
- What is my long-term plan for the business?
- What are the pros and cons of the different structures?
- What are my business needs?
- Is the business structure easy to set up, manage and close?
