### About PW Mark and PW Mark Plus

The PW Mark is an accreditation scheme that recognises eligible firms that pay progressive wages to lower-wage workers. It is administered by the Singapore Business Federation (SBF).

Firms that are eligible for the PW Mark and are awarded government contracts for new tenders called from 1 March 2023 and new quotations from 1 March 2024 must be accredited with the PW Mark for the contract period. Their subcontractors that are eligible for the PW Mark must also be accredited.

If your firm meets the eligibility requirements of the PW Mark and adopts the [Tripartite Standard on Advancing Well-being of Lower-Wage Workers (TS-LWW)](https://go.gov.sg/TS-LWW){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, your firm will be conferred the PW Mark Plus.
