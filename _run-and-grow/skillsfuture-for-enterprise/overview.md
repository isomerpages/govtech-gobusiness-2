### Benefits of investing in skills training

In 2021, the Ministry of Trade & Industry (MTI) and SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) published a study on the returns to employer-sponsored training and found positive effects. The study observed
training adoption of close to 150,000 enterprises over an 8-year period and found that:

For every 10% of the local workforce that companies supported for training:

- Labour productivity of firms was 2.2% higher on average per year for two years
- Company's revenue was 0.7% higher on average each year for up to three years after training
- Employee retention was 0.6% higher in the year of the training.
