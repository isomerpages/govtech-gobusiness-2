### Stay up-to-date on emerging trends
Equip your workforce to meet changing job demands and stay competitive for the future through the [SkillsFuture Series](https://www.skillsfuture.gov.sg/series){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.  It comprises a comprehensive curation of modular courses covering emerging skills in the four economic growth pillars (Digital, Green, Care, and Industry 4.0). 

### How to build a workplace learning culture 
As most learnings happen at the workplace, you might want to consider putting a structured process to harness the rich collaborative learning among your employees and optimise work performance. 

You can approach: [National Centre of Excellence for Workplace Learning (NACE)](/enterprisejobskills/programmes-and-initiatives/learn-at-the-workplace/national-centre-of-excellence-for-workplace-learning--nace-/) which offers training and consultancy to help companies set up workplace learning systems based on leading practices from Germany and Switzerland. 

### Already have an established workplace learning system?
Get recognised for your workplace learning efforts through the Workplace Learning:READY (WPL:READY) initiative, and help your workers get fast-tracked skills certifications through the Workplace Skills Recognition (WPSR) programme.

NACE is launching a new WPL:READY mark, which is a new foundational-level workplace learning certification targeted at helping SMEs develop effective on-the-job learning processes. Certified companies can work with SSGâ€™s appointed training partners to formally recognise the skills their workers trained on-the-job, without the need for further external training.

Find out more about the [certification process](https://www.nace.edu.sg/certifications/workplace-learning-ready-mark/introduction/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, and the [Workplace Skills Recognition programme](/enterprisejobskills/programmes-and-initiatives/learn-at-the-workplace/workplace-skills-recognition-programme/?src=rgp_skillsfuture_step5).
