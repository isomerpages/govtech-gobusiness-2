### Next steps to register

**Contact the training provider to confirm the following:**

- Course admission criteria (if any)

- Course schedule

- Funding eligibility of your organisation (SME status) and the employees you intend to register for the course(s)

- Whether the course is eligible for SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (SFEC) and Absentee Payroll (AP) funding 

- The net out-of-pocket amount you need to pay (after the subsidies are applied) and GST

Once you have identified your skills needs and registered your employees for the skills training courses, you can proceed to attend the relevant courses and submit your absentee payroll claims, where applicable, in [step 4](/skillsfuture-for-enterprise/claim-absentee-payroll-funding/?src=rgp_skillsfuture_step3).
