### Eligibility criteria of course fee subsidies for companies and employees

All companies registered or incorporated in Singapore, including non-business entities (e.g. Volunteer Welfare Organisations and societies) and sole proprietorships are eligible for course fee subsidies. 

Baseline course fee subsidies are available to lower the training fee when you sponsor your Singaporean, Permanent Resident, and Long Term Visitor Pass Plus (LTVP+) employees for SSG-funded courses

**For Singaporean employees:**

- **40 years old and above**: Up to 90% enhanced course fee subsidies under the SkillsFuture Mid-Career Enhanced Subsidy (MCES)

- **Below 40 years old**: Up to 70%

**For Permanent Resident and LTVP+ employees:**

- **All ages**: Up to 70%

### Enhanced Training Support for SMEs (ETSS)

**Singaporean, PR and LTVP+ employees of all age groups**: Up to 90%. If there is a change to your SME organisation’s status, you will need to submit a [SME declaration](https://sfec.enterprisejobskills.gov.sg/Callbackhandler/Prelogin.aspx){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to be eligible for enhanced course fee funding. 

**SME Eligibility Criteria:**

- Registered or incorporated in Singapore

- Your organisation’s employment size must not exceed 200, OR your organisation’s annual sales turnover must not exceed S$100 million

Please check the [summary of course fee rates](/enterprisejobskills/programmes-and-initiatives/upgrade-skills/course-fee-absentee-payroll-funding/) before deciding. 

- In most cases, the course fee subsidies are automatically computed and deducted from the course fee. 

- You only need to pay the net course fee and GST to the training provider. 

- You are advised to check with the training provider on the net course fee after SSG subsidies and GST before enrolling your employee to a training course.

### SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (SFEC)

The SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit (SFEC) is a S$10,000 credit provided by the government to further encourage enterprises to embark on business and workforce transformation (i.e. training). 

SFEC provides an additional 90% funding support for out-of-pocket expenses when eligible enterprises send their employees for SSG-funded training courses. Find out your SFEC balance by logging in to the [SkillsFuture Singapore's SFEC microsite](https://sfec.enterprisejobskills.gov.sg/Callbackhandler/Prelogin.aspx){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

There is no application required for SFEC. Enterprises that are eligible for SFEC will be notified by Enterprise Singapore in writing.
