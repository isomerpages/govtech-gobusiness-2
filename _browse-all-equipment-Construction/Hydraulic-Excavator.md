## Hydraulic Excavator

### Technical Requirements

Excavators equipped with regenerative energy systems and/or energy recovery systems capture and reuse energy that would otherwise be wasted during operations such as boom motions. By harnessing this recovered energy, these excavators significantly reduce fuel consumption and emissions compared to traditional models.
