## Trade marks and Intellectual Property (IP)

![Trade marks and Intellectual Property](/images/eservices/eServices_Trade marks and Intellectual Property (IP).jpg)

Your inventions, designs and representations of your brand are Intellectual Property (IP) assets that can be protected. You can do so by filing [trade marks](/intellectual-property/ip-grow/ip-search-and-registration/trade-mark-agent/), [patents](/intellectual-property/ip-grow/ip-search-and-registration/patent-agent/) or [designs](/intellectual-property/ip-grow/ip-search-and-registration/registered-design-agent/).

Learn more about them in our [Start-up Guide](/start-a-business/protect-your-ideas/).
