<H3>Application Details</H3>

Required for the retail of electricity to contestable consumers.

Retail electricity licensees (electricity retailers) are entities authorised by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) to retail electricity to contestable consumers.

There are two types of electricity retailers: Market Participant Retailers (MPRs) and Non-Market Participant Retailers (NMPRs).

MPRs have to be registered with the Energy Market Company (EMC) to purchase electricity from the National Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS) to sell to contestable consumers.

NMPRs need not register with EMC to participate in the NEMS, as they will purchase electricity indirectly from the NEMS through the Market Support Services Licensee (MSSL).

For more information on becoming a retailer, you may refer to EMA's Guide to Becoming a Licensed Electricity Retailer available via https://www.ema.gov.sg/regulations-licences/licences/industry-licences.

FAQ
Does the licence guarantee a registration to the Market Company?
The issuance of a licence does not guarantee your registration as a market participant by the Market Company.
Are there any requirements to be met?
Please note the following two requirements to be met by each retailer after being issued an Electricity Retailer Licence before it can commence retailing electricity:

Requirement 1:Pass the Market Trial conducted by SP Group. For more information, please refer to the Open Electricity Market's website (www.openelectricitymarket.sg); and

Requirement 2:Satisfy EMA's requirements for participation in the Open Electricity Market. For more information, please email EMA_MDSD_RETAIL@ema.gov.sg.

Retailers who only meet Requirement 1 (i.e., passed the Market Trial conducted by SP Group) can only retail electricity to business consumers with an average monthly consumption of at least 2MWh.

Retailers must meet both requirements before they can start retailing electricity to (i) business consumers with an average monthly consumption of less than 2MWh, and (ii) all residential consumers.

<strong>Additional Information</strong>

Fees
The annual licence fee is payable each April for the Financial Year starting 1 April. The initial licence fee payable upon issuance of the licence is pro-rated based on the number of days remaining in the current Financial Year.

Contact Details
You may contact EMA directly if you require further details on the fees for each licence class.
