    - title: Is mask wearing mandatory in F&B establishments?
      content: |
        The legal requirement for mask wearing in indoor settings has been removed, with the exception of indoor healthcare and residential care<sup>1</sup> as well as public transport<sup>2</sup> settings. 

        F&B establishments in these settings should ensure that customers and working personnel, including food delivery personnel, wear their masks when not eating or drinking.  

        Mask wearing in other settings is optional. However, we encourage individuals to exercise precaution (for example, wear their masks in crowded areas). 

        Mask wearing required as part of sectoral regulations, such as the Singapore Food Agency's (SFA) requirement for food handlers, will continue to apply.

        All personnel engaged in the sale and preparation of food and drinks at all F&B establishments are required to wear a mask or spit guard<sup>3</sup>. This applies to those involved in the following:
        
        - Processing, preparation of ingredients and/or cooking of food.
        
        - Packing of cooked and/or Ready-to-Eat food/ Handling unsealed finished products (including wet market food stalls)
        
        - Dishing of cooked and/or Ready-to-Eat food to consumers
        
        - Preparation of drinks

        Personnel are not required to put on masks/ spit guards if they are only involved in the following:
        
        - Bringing plated food to consumers
        
        - Delivery of packed/ bento food to consumers (e.g. food delivery personnel)
        
        - Cleaning activities (e.g. collection of used crockery/ utensils, washing or cleaning of dining tables)
        
        - Collection of payment from customers

        Please refer to the [SFA's advisory](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-document-library/media-release-advisory-on-wearing-of-masks-or-spit-guards-by-food-handlers_24aug22.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details.
