      content: |
        "A Singpass Foreign user Account is a Singpass account that allows foreign users to transact with selected government digital services in Singapore. This includes accessing digital services on GoBusiness Dashboard.

        For Business licensing matters, you will be automatically issued a Singpass Foreign user Account by Corppass when you register a Corppass user account. In this case, you do not need to apply for a Singpass Foreign user Account with GoBusiness."
