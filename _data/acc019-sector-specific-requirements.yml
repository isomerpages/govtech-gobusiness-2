  - title: Funeral events
    content: |
      As we step down the COVID-19 measures and establish a new endemic COVID-19 norm to resume normalcy in our daily activities, there will be no Safe Management Measures (SMMs) required for funeral events (with effect from 13 Feb 2023).
      
      1. Mask-wearing is not required for funeral events. As mask-wearing is an effective way to minimise the risk of infectious diseases, we encourage attendees of funeral wakes, cremation, burial services, and funeral services providers to wear masks in crowded places, or when visiting or interacting with vulnerable persons.
      
      2. We strongly advise individuals who are unwell with symptoms of COVID-19 or other respiratory infections to wear a mask when they need to attend these events.
      
      3. Food and drinks, including self-service buffet lines and individually packed food and titbits, are allowed to be served and consumed at funeral wakes. Singapore Food Agency (SFA) regulations and Food & Beverage (F&B) sector guidelines must be adhered to.
      
      4. Food and drinks remain to be prohibited at NEA-managed facilities (e.g. Mandai Crematorium and Choa Chu Kang Cemetery).
