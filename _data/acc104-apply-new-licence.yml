      Step 1: Log in to GoBusiness Dashboard and choose Licence -> [Apply Licence](https://dashboard.gobusiness.gov.sg/add-tasks?src=faq_db_applynewlic) from the top menu bar.

      Step 2: Select the licence you wish to apply for and you will be redirected to the application form (for licences available on GoBusiness) or respective government website (for licences that are not available on GoBusiness yet)

      If you are a self-employed person (SEP), please note that licensing authorities will only process your licence application if your MediSave payable is up-to-date, that is, you have either paid your MediSave in full or have an active GIRO arrangement with the Board to settle your MediSave payable. You can check your MediSave payment status, make MediSave contributions in full or sign up for a GIRO instalment plan by logging in to the [Self-employment dashboard](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/service/article/what-is-my-dashboards-and-what-is-available-in-my-dashboards) using your Singpass.

      Under the Central Provident Fund Board's Self-Employed Scheme, all SEPs who are Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents and earn an annual net trade income (NTI) of more than $6,000 need to contribute to MediSave. To find out more about the Self-Employed Scheme, visit [cpf.gov.sg/selfemployedmatters](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/growing-your-savings/cpf-contributions/saving-as-a-self-employed-person).
