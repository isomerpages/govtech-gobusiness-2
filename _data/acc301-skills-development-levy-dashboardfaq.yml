    - title: Should I use GoBusiness or CPF to pay my SDL?

        CPF EZPay is for employers to pay for employees' monthly SDL, together with their CPF contributions. You can also use it to pay for foreign employees in the same transaction.

        The SDL payment service on GoBusiness is for employers who have forgotten to pay / underpaid their SDL, or who only have foreign employees.

    - title: Who will be able to access SDL on GoBusiness?
      content: |
       Anyone in your organisation who has been granted Corppass access to GoBusiness Dashboard will be able to access SDL on GoBusiness.
    
    - title: How do I access SDL information and perform SDL-related transactions?

    - title: How is the outstanding SDL payable calculated?
      content: |
        Employers can download the monthly breakdown of the SDL payable, SDL paid and estimated outstanding SDL payable from the [SDL page](https://dashboard.gobusiness.gov.sg/sdl){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} via the Download Details button. This will give an overview of how the outstanding SDL payable amount was calculated.

        Please review your organisation's payroll records to determine the SDL payable for your local and foreign employees and the amount of SDL you have previously paid for the period.

        You may verify your payroll records using the SDL rate of 0.25% of the monthly remuneration<sup>*</sup> for each employee<sup>*</sup>, with the minimum payable of $2 (for an employee earning less than $800 a month) and a maximum of $11.25 (for an employee earning more than $4,500 a month) and calculate the SDL payable amount using the SDL calculator. 

        <sup>*</sup> Please refer to the definition of "remuneration" and “employee” found in Section 2 of the Skills Development Levy Act 1979.

        If you do not agree with the calculation, you will be able to correct the amount by filling and submitting the "Declaration Form" template via the [SDL Payment & Declaration form](https://dashboard.gobusiness.gov.sg/sdl/make-payment){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

    - title: How do I make my SDL payment on GoBusiness?
      content: |
        Employers with local employees are encouraged to make their monthly SDL payments together with their CPF contribution through CPF EZPay. 

        Employers should only use GoBusiness to make ad-hoc SDL payments or monthly SDL payments when they do not need to make monthly CPF contributions. Please refer to the [General SDL FAQ](/skills-development-levy-faqs/) for more details and requirements.

        1. Log in to GoBusiness Dashboard as a Business User, and go to Levy > Skills Development Levy (SDL).

        2. Click the Make Payment / Declaration button to get to the SDL Payment & Declaration form.

        3. Review the Applicant and Company Detail in the General Information page and update contact information, if necessary. Click Next to go to the next page.

        4. In Application Details, select the full month(s) you are making outstanding payment for. For example, if you are making payment for July and August 2022, select 01/07/2022 for Start Date, and 31/08/2022 for End Date.

        Click on the Retrieve SDL Records button after selecting the month(s) range.

        5. Subsequent sections will be populated with the relevant periods and SDL records, where available. For the Relevant Period with SSG Records section, you will need to confirm the SDL payable and make a declaration if your records differ. For the Relevant Period Without SSG Records section, you will need to provide your computation before making payment as SSG will not have your records for the last 2 to 3 months.

        6. If your internal records differ from SSG's SDL records, select "I would like to submit a declaration for..." in the declaration section. Thereafter, indicate your own records in the available SDL fields and attach the "Declaration Form" (insert url: https://go.gov.sg/sdl-declaration-form) as a supporting document. If your internal records have no discrepencies with SSG's SDL records, select "I agree with SSG's records".

        7. Proceed to make payment either via online payment  (stripe/ credit card) through GoBusiness; or offline payment (bank transfer or PayNow) where payment instructions will be communicated separately over email from SSG.

        8. Track your transaction status on SDL Page, under SDL notifications

    - title: What is a SDL Declaration Form?
      content: |
        The SDL Declaration Form serves as a declaration of the outstanding SDL payable that you have verified against your own payroll records and that you have made payment for it.

    - title: When do I need to submit the declaration on Outstanding SDL Payable for my employees?
      content: |
        You will need to submit the SDL Declaration Form when your calculated SDL payable differs from the amount stated in our records.

    - title: The SDL amounts shown is different from my records. What should I do?
      content: |
        If you do not agree with our calculation, you will be able to correct the amount by filling and submitting the Declaration Form template via our SDL Payment & Declaration form:

        1.) Log in to GoBusiness Dashboard as a Business User, and go to Levy > Skills Development Levy (SDL)

        2.) Click on the Make Payment / Declaration button to get to the SDL Payment & Declaration form.

        3.) Review the Applicant and Company Detail in the General Information page and update contact information, if necessary. Click Next to go to the next page.

        4.) In Application Details, select the full month(s) you are making outstanding SDL payment and/or declaration. For example, if you are making payment for July and August 2022, select 01/07/2022 for Start Date, and 31/08/2022 for End Date.

        Click on the Retrieve SDL Records button after selecting the month(s) range.

        5.) Depending on your selected Relevant period, "Relevant Period with SSG Records" section (refers to period where wage data from Government's records for all your local and foreign employees are available to derive your SDL Payable) or "Relevant Period without SSG Records" section or both sections will be displayed. "SDL Paid" refers to the amount of SDL you have previously paid for the relevant period.
        
        6.) When the Relevant Period Without SSG Records section is displayed, you will only be able to see an amount in SDL Paid if you have previously made payment for this relevant period. The Revised SDL Paid for the Relevant Period Without SDL Records section is an optional field and can be left blank unless your SDL Paid records differ from ours. However, it is mandatory to provide your computed Outstanding SDL Payable for Relevant Period Without SSG Records.

        7.) In the Provision of Employer Records (for GoBusiness to confirm) section, select the period that you would like to submit a declaration.
        The list of values for “I would like to submit a declaration” will be populated via GoBusiness and SSG, depending on the applicable date range. 

        "I would like to submit a declaration for Relevant Period with SSG records"<br>
        "I would like to submit a declaration for Relevant Period without SSG records"<br>
        "I would like to submit a declaration for both Relevant Periods with and without SSG records"<br>
        "I agree with SSG's records"

        8.) If you have selected to submit a declaration, you are required to fill in your own monthly computation in the [Declaration Form template](https://go.gov.sg/sdl-declaration-form){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} as a supporting document for the relevant period selected and upload the template. You are also required to fill in your aggregated SDL Payable, SDL Paid and Outstanding SDL Payable for the full relevant period. The figures should match what's in your Declaration Form - this is quite confusing.. are we trying to say that what's filled up in "declaration form" section should match with the supporting document in "Upload Declaration Form"?.

        9.) Select the payment mode before clicking Review Form to proceed to the Declaration Review page.

        10.) Once you have verified the details shown in the Review page, you may proceed to submit with and without payment, depending on whether there is any outstanding SDL payable.

      content: |
