      Do I need to apply for this licence?	You will need to apply for a Food Stall Licence if you intend to operate a retail food stall where food and/or drink are sold wholly by retail. It is a requirement under the Environmental Public Health Act. The purpose of licensing is to ensure cleanliness and food safety in food retail outlets and to prevent food-borne diseases.

      Examples of businesses that require a food stall licence are food stalls in private eating houses, coffeeshops, food courts, canteens, private markets.

      If you are interested in operating a hawker stall in a NEA-managed food centre/market, you need to first bid for a food stall in NEA's tender. Once you have secured a food stall in a successful bid and signed the tenancy agreement with NEA, a hawker stall licence will then be issued to you by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA).
