        <p># The legal requirement for SDL contributions by employers was introduced via gazette in Oct 1979. For employers who need to know the rates earlier than 1 July 2000, they may contact SSG for direct assistance.</p>

        * Prior to 1 October 2008, an employer does not have to contribute SDL for employees whose monthly remuneration is above the salary ceiling. However, with effect from 1 October 2008, an employer will have to contribute SDL even if the monthly remuneration exceeds the salary ceiling. This is because the revised SDL regulations stipulate that the contribution is up to the first $4,500 of monthly remuneration.

        The Government will review the levy rate regularly and any revision will take into account the need to maintain workforce and industry competitiveness through continuous skills upgrading and development.

    - title: Why do I have to pay both SDL and Foreign Worker Levy (FWL) for foreign employees?
      content: |
        Both the SDL and FWL serve different purposes.

        SDL contributions are channelled to the Skills Development Fund which is used to build a national Continuing Education and Training (CET) system and provide financial assistance for employers to send their employees for training under the national CET system.

        FWL is a levy imposed via the Ministry of Manpower for the administration of foreign workers with work permits.
        
    - title: If an employer engages a third party agent to pay remuneration on its behalf to its (the employer's) employees, does the employer still have to pay SDL?
      content: |
        Yes. For example, Company A has five employees and is liable to pay remuneration to those employees. Company A engages a third party agent, Company B, to pay remuneration to the five employees on its (Company A's) behalf. There is no contractual relationship between Company B and the employees.

          1. The student is a matriculated or registered student of the institution; and
          2. The student is required by the institution to undergo training in Singapore.

    - title: Can employers be exempted from paying SDL if they are not tapping on SDF training assistance?
      content: |
        No. The collection of SDL and the disbursement of SDF training assistance are separate matters.

        SDF training assistance is given as financial incentives for employers to upgrade their workers' skills. The SDL payment by an employer is not tied to the amount of funding the employer can obtain from SDF to train its workers. For details on SDF funding, please visit the SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) website.
    
    - title: If there's a change in the shareholders of a company, or a change in the partners of a limited liability partnership (LLP), is the company or LLP required to pay the outstanding SDL?

    - title: How do employers calculate SDL for months with bonus pay-outs or allowances?
      content: |
        For a month where the employee is paid bonus or allowance, the amount of bonus or allowance is considered as remuneration for that month.

        For example, if the employee's salary for December is $3,000 and the bonus paid in December is $1,000, SDL should be calculated based on $4,000 ($3,000 +$1,000). SDL payable is $10 ($4,000 x 0.25%)."

        The remuneration can be converted to Singapore dollars using any of the published exchange rates used by a major local bank.

    - title: How do I calculate SDL for employees who are on paid leave or no-pay leave?

        [Section F - see [current FAQ](https://sdl.ssg.gov.sg/Docs/SDL-Frequently-Asked-Questions.pdf)]
          
        For foreign employees, employers can use SSG's SDL online calculator to work out the SDL contribution and indicate the lump sum payment under the ""Skills Development Levy (SDL) - For foreign employees"" section in the same transaction."

    - title: How do employers calculate SDL for months with bonus pay-outs or allowances?
      content: |
        The bonus pay-outs or allowances should be added to the monthly salary and employers should use the total sum to determine the SDL for their employees. For example, if the employee's salary for Dec 2014 is $3,000 and the bonus paid in Dec 2014 is $1,000, SDL should be calculated based on $4,000 ($3,000 +$1,000). In this scenario, SDL payable is $10 ($4,000 x 0.25%).

    - title: What should I do if I do not want the system to auto-compute the SDL amount?
      content: |
        We strongly encourage the use of the auto-computation feature which improves your convenience in making SDL contributions.
 
        To disable the auto-computation during the online submission, employers can edit the ""SDL To be Paid"" field or set the SDL payable option to ""No"" for certain employees who do not require SDL contributions.
