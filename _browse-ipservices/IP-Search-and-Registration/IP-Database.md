## IP database services

### What is an IP database?

An intellectual property (IP) database offers a vast collection of IP registration records, including patent filings and trademark registrations. Users can easily access valuable information about a particular IP, such as the name of the inventor or owner, its classification (e.g. by technology, type of product) and the jurisdictions where the IP was filed. 

IP information can provide unique market and technology insights, as IP is often registered ahead of a product launch. On top of that, an estimated 70% of the technical information in patents – which informs how new inventions work – is only published on IP databases. 


### Benefits of IP database services

By leveraging insights from IP databases, your business can analyse competitors, find potential collaborators and opportunities, and assess its research and development ideas. It can be a powerful source of data to tap on to make better-informed decisions about your IP strategies. 

Generally, national and international IP offices provide free access to their IP databases, while commercial databases are available as paid subscription services. Commercial databases may offer more functions such as licensing records, verified translation features, and advanced search and analytics tools.
