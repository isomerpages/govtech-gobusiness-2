## Freedom-to-operate services

If you are looking to commercialise a new product or service, it is essential to take proactive steps to ensure you are not infringing on someone elseâ€™s patent rights. 

### What is a freedom-to-operate (FTO) analysis?

Patents are a form of intellectual property (IP) that give patent owners exclusive rights to their inventions. Conducting a FTO analysis can help you determine whether your new product or service might infringe on third-party patent rights in your targeted markets. 

This process typically involves a comprehensive search of relevant patents based on key features of your product or service and an assessment of the risk of any infringement. Since IP rights can only be enforced in jurisdictions where they are registered, you should ideally conduct the FTO search in countries where you intend to commercialise the product or service.

### Benefits of freedom-to-operate services

Getting FTO clearance can help you avoid costly legal disputes and potential infringement lawsuits. It ensures that you are free to launch a product or service in a specific market without violating the patent rights of others.
