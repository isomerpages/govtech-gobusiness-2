## Patent Agent Services

Innovation and technology are the backbone of many successful businesses, especially start-ups. With increasing competition, finding ways to commercialise your inventions while keeping them safe from copycats can be challenging. This is where patents come in. 

### What is a patent?

Patents are a form of intellectual property (IP) that can help your business protect its inventions, safeguarding its competitive advantage and potential profits against copycats. Should a patent be granted, you will hold the exclusive rights to prevent others from using, reproducing, or commercialising your invention without your permission.

### Benefits of patent agent services

How you craft your patent application and decisions on where and how to file your patent application can greatly affect the eventual patent protection you get (or do not get). 
Patent agents can be instrumental in helping you make informed decisions and navigate the challenging patent application process. They are certified professionals who can assess your invention's patentability, prepare and file patent applications, and advise you on the validity and infringement of patents. With their expertise, you can maximise your chances of obtaining strong patents based on your business needs.
