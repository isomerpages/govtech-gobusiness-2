## Registered Design Agent services

Suppose you have a new product with a unique design featuring a distinct shape, combination of colours, or pattern. If you want to prevent others from copying your design, this is where registered designs can come into play. 

### What is a registered design?

A registered design gives you exclusive ownership of the visible appearance of your product. Some notable examples include the shape of a Volkswagen Beetle and the contours of an Apple iPhone. It is important to note that registered designs do not protect the functional aspects of a product, which may require patent protection instead.

### Benefits of registered design agent services

To help your business protect its designs, registered design agents offer an array of services, including preparing and filing the design application and ensuring compliance with all the requirements for registration. 

The scope of protection you receive is determined by how you represent your product design and the countries where you choose to file in. A registered design agent can advise on whether your design is suitable for registration, assist with decision-making, and facilitate the application process to help you secure the most appropriate degree of protection.
