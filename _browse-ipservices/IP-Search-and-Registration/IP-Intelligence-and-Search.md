## IP intelligence and search services

In today's competitive world, one way for businesses to gain an edge is by employing IP intelligence and search to uncover valuable insights about competitors and emerging trends. 

### What is IP intelligence and search?

Intellectual property (IP) intelligence and search refers to a process of gathering and analysing IP-related data to provide businesses with relevant information on their industry and technologies. This may reveal hints about a competitor’s rebranding intentions, upcoming product or service offerings, available technologies, key players (competitors, licensees, collaborators etc), and key transactions. Conducting IP searches can also help your company benchmark its technology against existing ones.

For example, a month before Meta launched its payment platform Meta Pay, the tech company filed trade marks related to digital currency and exchange services. Similarly, the Apple Watch was heralded by Apple’s patent filings in the field of wearable technology before its launch in 2015. By tracking Meta and Apple’s IP filings, investors and competitors could anticipate these product launches and adjust their strategies accordingly. 

### Benefits of IP intelligence and search services

By leveraging IP information, your business can make informed decisions about their IP and business strategies, including:

- Determining which markets to target;

- Identifying products or services to develop based on interest and demand; 

- Deciding whether to file patent or trade mark applications;

- Evaluating whether to invest in research and development or license a technology. 

There are public IP databases that you can tap on to perform your analyses. Performing IP searches can be complex and technical, especially for patent searches. If you are not familiar with performing IP searches and analytics, you can engage IP intelligence and search professionals to perform the analyses on your behalf, saving you a lot of time.
