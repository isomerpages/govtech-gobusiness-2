## IP watch services

### What is IP watch?

Having an intellectual property (IP) watch in place is an effective way to protect your company's creations and inventions. Similar to a surveillance service, companies that offer IP watch services regularly monitor for potential infringement to ensure that your IP is not being copied or used without your permission, as well as monitor the activities of your competitors.

### Benefits of IP watch services

By employing an IP watch service, your business can proactively protect its interests and anticipate potential threats to its IP. It includes 

- Monitoring IP filings to detect and alert you of any conflicting IP, enabling you to oppose them based on your IP rights;

- Monitoring IP filings to track the activities of competitors in a particular industry;

- Monitoring of online spaces for IP infringement.
