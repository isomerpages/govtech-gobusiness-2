## IP due diligence services

Just as how one would inspect a car before buying it or verify the ownership of an apartment unit prior to a sale, companies often seek to find out the status of a company’s intellectual property (IP) assets before investing in or acquiring it. This process is known as IP due diligence.

### What is IP due diligence?

IP due diligence involves a thorough investigation of the IP owned by a business. IP due diligence services are typically provided by IP law firms or IP firms. They perform a detailed review of a target company's IP portfolio by identifying and validating all the IP that the company owns or utilises. They also assess how effective these IP assets are in supporting the target company’s business. 

### Benefits of IP due diligence services

During this process, the strengths and weaknesses of the IP assets are evaluated to identify business risks and opportunities. The findings of this evaluation are often used by companies to support fundraising activities or make informed decisions on whether to pursue a partnership or acquisition of a target company.

Conducting IP due diligence empowers your business with valuable information to make informed decisions, minimising the risks of financial and legal complications associated with the IP assets of a target company.
