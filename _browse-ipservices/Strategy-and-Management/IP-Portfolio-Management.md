## IP portfolio management services

Without proper care of your company's IP, you risk losing it, along with wasting the time and resources invested in its growth. 

Effective management of your IP portfolio helps to address this concern. As some companies may not have the resources or systems in place to proactively manage their IP assets, enlisting a team of professionals to do so will be beneficial.

### What is IP portfolio management?

Generally, IP portfolio management refers to the administration of a company's IP assets, which includes activities such as monitoring filed applications and renewal dates. If you have the resources but not the systems in place, some service providers may also offer IP management software such as docketing software and trade secret management software. 

### Benefits of IP portfolio management services

Businesses that lack the manpower or financial means to manage their IP assets can leverage on these services to ensure that their IP registrations are maintained over time and that their non-registered IP like trade secrets are properly managed and protected. 

IP portfolio management enables your business to identify cost-saving opportunities and consolidate all its IP onto a single platform. Having an overview of your IP portfolio is especially important if you have multiple IP across different countries.
