## IP audit services

The importance and advantages of ntangible assets are often overlooked. For example, the iconic Apple logo carries huge brand value and serves as a key driver for Apple’s success, yet it does not appear in the company’s balance sheet. Conducting an intellectual property (IP) audit can help you identify and assess these invaluable resources. 

### What is an IP audit? 

Typically, an IP audit involves evaluating a company’s IP assets – its strength, scope, opportunities, and risks – in alignment with its business goals. IP audit services can help your business gain a holistic picture of its key IP assets and their contribution to the business. 

### Benefits of an IP audit

With these insights, your business can identify areas in its IP management that require attention and prioritise the IP assets that are critical to achieving your business goals. It serves as a strong foundation for developing an IP strategy that can propel your business forward, as well as leverage for valuation and financing opportunities.
