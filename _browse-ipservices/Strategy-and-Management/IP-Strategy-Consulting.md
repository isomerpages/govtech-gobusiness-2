## IP strategy consulting services

Intangible assets and intellectual property (IP) have become one of the most valuable assets of a business. According to a Brand Finance study, the global value of intangible assets has grown by 11% per annum since 1996 to reach US$74 trillion, surpassing the value of physical assets.

From cutting-edge technology and invaluable data to original content and insider know-how, your wealth of IP assets is what builds your competitive advantage and differentiates you from the crowd. 

### What is an IP strategy?

An effective IP strategy involves the proper identification of key IP assets, evaluation of the risks and opportunities of each IP asset, and plans to protect, use, and leverage these assets to grow the business. IP strategy consultants can assist your business in aligning the management and use of your prized IP assets to your business goals and objectives.

### Benefits of IP strategy consulting services

With a well-crafted IP strategy, your business is better placed to strengthen its market position and attract new business opportunities, in turn growing the value of your IP assets. Without an IP strategy, businesses risk neglecting or, at worst, losing their most valuable IP assets and falling behind in todayâ€™s fiercely competitive landscape.
