## Tax advisory services (with IA/IP considerations) 

Businesses that develop, acquire, and capitalise on intellectual property (IP) may reduce their tax bills by claiming reliefs or deductions through various schemes in Singapore. While navigating these tax schemes may be complicated, doing so can be highly advantageous. Engaging a tax advisor will help to simplify this process and increase your chances of maximising your tax savings.

### What are tax advisory services (with IA/IP considerations)?

IP tax advisory services are typically provided by experienced professionals such as tax lawyers, accountants, and financial advisors specialising in IP and taxation. They work closely with businesses to analyse their IP development activities and IP portfolios to identify tax saving opportunities. This may involve planning where to locate research and development activities, analysing cross-border tax regimes, developing tax-efficient structures for IP asset holdings, and advising on tax submissions.

### Benefits of tax advisory services (with IA/IP considerations)

By working with an experienced tax advisor, businesses can identify tax-saving opportunities they may have overlooked. This can help companies take full advantage of the range of IP-related tax schemes available in Singapore, freeing up more resources for growth and expansion.
