## IP brokerage and licensing services

Your company’s intellectual property (IP) – such as your technology and brand – can be monetised in various ways. While most companies use their IP in their products, it can also be sold or licensed to generate value.

### What are some types of IP licensing?

One well-known form of IP licensing is a food and beverage (F&B) franchise, where the franchisor grants the franchisee the right to use their brand, recipes, know-how, and other intangible assets for a fee. Singapore-based brands such as Ya Kun Kaya Toast and Old Chang Kee have adopted this F&B franchise model with much success. 

There are also other forms of IP licensing, such as brand licensing and technology licensing, which allow others to use your brand or incorporate your technology into their products.

### Benefits of IP brokerage and licensing

By exploring IP licensing as a monetisation opportunity, you may discover new and sustainable revenue streams for your business. However, it can be challenging to market your IP, identify and engage suitable licensees, and negotiate a licensing deal on your own.

This is where IP brokerage and licensing professionals can come in. They act as intermediaries to proactively source for IP you need, find potential licensees, and support and facilitate negotiations to conclude a transaction. With the help of an IP broker, you can develop a licensing structure that will protect your IP assets, while maximising long-term returns.
