## IP marketplace services

### What is an IP marketplace?

Intangible assets (IA) and intellectual property (IP) are usually created by companies with the intention of using them in their products or services. However, there is also potential for IA/IP to be monetised through various means such as licensing, franchising, and selling. An IP marketplace service provides a platform to facilitate this process of IA/IP monetisation. 

IP marketplace services enable businesses to find IA/IP for acquisition or list their own IA/IP for licensing and sale. These services are generally provided by specialised online platforms that connect IA/IP owners with potential buyers or licensees and vice versa. 

### Benefits of an IP marketplace

By selling or licensing their IA/IP, your business can make use of IA/IP in markets where you lack the resources for its commercialisation, expand your business through strategic partnerships in new markets, and unlock new opportunities to leverage your IA/IP.

For businesses needing help sourcing or selling their IP, head to [IP Brokerage and Licensing Services](/intellectual-property/Commercialisation-and-Financing/IP-Brokerage-and-Licensing/?src=ipgrow-ip-marketplace).
