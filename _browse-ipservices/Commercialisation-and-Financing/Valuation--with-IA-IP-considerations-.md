## Valuation services (with IA/IP considerations) 

If you are preparing for a fund raise, a joint venture, a merger and acquisition deal, or a transaction involving your intellectual property (IP) assets like a technology licence, it may be prudent to seek an independent valuation to determine your market value or the value of your contribution to a transaction.

### What are valuation services (with IA/IP considerations)?

Valuation services that consider traditional factors such as a company’s financials, market comparables, and future earnings prospects are widely available. However, these traditional valuation methods may not fully account for the value and risks associated with a company’s intangible assets (IA) and IP. Hence, it is essential to consider valuation services that specifically factor in IA/IP considerations if you are an IP-rich company. These services supplement traditional valuation methods by assessing how a company’s IP assets can mitigate business risks or enhance the predictability or stability of its future cash flows.

### Benefits of valuation services (with IA/IP considerations)

One major benefit of valuation services that incorporate IA/IP considerations is that they provide a more holistic assessment of a company or a transaction’s value. Because of this, companies with strong IA/IP may potentially obtain a higher valuation, ultimately benefitting their business.
