## IP training services

In today’s business world, intangible assets (IA) are everywhere – from the logo representing a business to employees’ knowledge and practical skills. Companies must understand intangible assets and constantly develop their capabilities in managing them. One way to build or improve such capabilities is through IP training services. These services are designed to equip businesses with the knowledge to recognise IP and its importance. 

### What are IP training services?

IP training services are typically provided by IP training institutes, academic institutions, and IP experts. They offer a range of training programmes, from seminars covering IP fundamentals to master’s programmes in IP. They may also provide customised training programmes tailored to the specific needs of a business to train employees in generating IP awareness and developing specialised IP capabilities.

### Benefits of IP training services

Businesses often miss out on identifying valuable IP due to a lack of IP awareness, which may prove costly when IP is poorly managed. IP training services address this by enabling businesses to have a strong understanding of IP, which may lead them to improve their management of IP assets within the organisation.
