## Contract drafting services

In business, contracts are necessary for protecting your interests and establishing clear expectations and responsibilities for all parties involved. This is especially true for contracts involving intellectual property (IP). 

### What are contract drafting services (with IA/IP considerations)?

Contract drafting services are typically provided by law firms, which involve creating and reviewing formal agreements. These agreements range from employee contracts and non-disclosure agreements to contracts governing transactions such as licences or research collaborations. It also includes advising companies on how contract terms may affect their commercial interests. 

Companies engaging in activities with third parties that involve IP creation and transactions are strongly encouraged to engage a law firm to advise on the agreement governing the activities with the external parties.   

### Benefits of contract drafting services (with IA/IP considerations)

Contract drafting services help businesses understand the commercial implications of the terms outlined in the agreement. By clearly defining each partyâ€™s roles, responsibilities, rights and obligations, a well-drafted contract can reduce the risk of misunderstandings or disputes and accurately reflect the intentions of the parties involved. 

In the context of intangible assets (IA) and IP, having a well-written contract can help businesses secure or commercialise their IA/IP rights, understand their contractual obligations, and reduce the risk of IA/IP disputes arising from contract ambiguity. A well-drafted contract for your IA/IP can also help businesses demonstrate their commitment to protecting their IA to investors and stakeholders.
