## Dispute resolution services

Have you stumbled on a copycat product or counterfeit in the market or received a letter from a law firm accusing you of intellectual property (IP) infringement? Safeguarding intangible assets is crucial for businesses, but what happens when disputes arise? In such situations, having legal professionals by your side to help you navigate conflicts can be valuable.

### What are dispute resolution services?

Dispute resolution services, typically provided by law firms and legal professionals such as mediators and arbitrators, are intended to resolve conflicts between parties. IP-related disputes may arise when you wish to enforce your IP rights (such as removing counterfeit products from the market), when accused of infringing a third partyâ€™s IP rights (such as receiving a cease-and-desist letter), or when disputes result from a contract (such as breaches of confidentiality). Depending on its nature, negotiation, mediation,  arbitration, and litigation are some methods that may be employed to resolve the dispute. 

### Benefits of dispute resolution services

Given the legal implications and costs of disputes, businesses are always encouraged to seek the assistance of a dispute resolution service provider whenever a potential dispute arises. This allows them to fully understand their available options. 

Disputes can be costly and time-consuming. If not handled properly, they can damage a company's reputation or even result in substantial legal penalties. Engaging professional guidance and support throughout the process can help businesses avoid costly litigation by exploring more efficient and effective ways to resolve disputes.
