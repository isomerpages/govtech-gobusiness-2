## What is SGSecure @ Workplaces?

SGSecure@Workplaces is a national programme to help businesses to prepare and mitigate the possible impact from terrorism. A terror attack can disrupt business operations. Employees may stop reporting to work, and lives may be lost. You may be affected even if the attack does not happen at your workplace. E.g. if your supply chain is affected by an attack.
 
The threat of terrorism in Singapore continues to remain real and present. Workplaces, being an important part of our community, can take practical steps to better prepare their workplaces to stay resilient in the face of terror threats. Adopt the 3P approach at your workplace to build up organisational resilience against terrorism.
 
- Prepare your workforce

Employees are businesses’ greatest assets. It is crucial to prepare them with the right knowledge and skills to prevent and deal with crises. If an attack happens, a prepared and cohesive workforce can minimise the downtime and return the business to normalcy quickly.
 
- Protect your workplace

Risk management plans and mitigation measures are critical to ensure that businesses can withstand crises. Taking these steps during peacetime will enable businesses to prevent and minimise potential losses, and resume operations quickly after crises.
 
- Partner your community

The impact of a terror attack extends beyond the point of attack. Operations may be disrupted if partners are affected. Build up a network with the community and along your value chain to solve problems collectively. Strong community networks strengthen vigilance and boost the ability to respond effectively and swiftly to crises.
