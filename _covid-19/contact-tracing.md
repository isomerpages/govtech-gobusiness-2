### Stepping Down TraceTogether (TT) and SafeEntry (SE)

TT and SE served us well during the acute phase of the pandemic by accelerating our contact tracing efforts and enabling the implementation of community safe management measures. Over the past few months, as the pandemic situation stabilised, the Government has progressively stepped down TT and SE.  

Enterprises may uninstall the SE (Business) App. It is nevertheless useful to keep both the TT and SE systems ready for reactivation for the contingency when a new, more dangerous Variant of Concern breaks out. The SE (Business) App will remain available on the App Store, Google Play Store and Huawei AppGallery for quick reactivation if needed. For this purpose, registration details such as name, business UEN, and mobile number will be retained in the system, to minimise the steps taken by individuals and companies to set up and re-register for TT and SE, should it be needed.
